# Git Talk

Git is a pretty cool tool that enables developers to quickly and effectively
handle multiple versioning within a code base. The purpose of this talk is to
introduce the three aspects of changes within git.

## Building & Running 

Slides are written in markup and compiled into revealjs slides using a tool
called pandoc. You can easily get pandoc from your favorite package manager:

### OS X (Homebrew)

`brew install pandoc`

### Compiling Slides
`pandoc -t revealjs -s git-talk.md -o git-talk.html`
